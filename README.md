# Proposed assignment by Ligo

This a the repository for the proposed assignment by Ligo

# Implemented user stories:

1. As a user I should be able to enter my name at the start of the Quiz
2. As a Quiz user, I see one question at a time to answer
3. During the Quiz the user can go back and forth through the different
questions
4. After submission at the end of the Quiz the user can see the final result
5. As a Quiz user, I have 2 wildcards. A wildcard can be used in any question at any time. Using a wildcard in any question will remove the worse of the answers from the possible answers list of that question. (The worse answer is calculated based on the answer points)
